# Airline Database SQL Analysis  

## Overview  
This project focuses on executing advanced SQL queries on an airline database to derive meaningful insights. The queries analyze key aspects of airline operations, such as ticket bookings, passenger records, flight schedules, and aircraft details. It leverages essential SQL techniques, including joins, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), window functions, and date manipulation.  

## Database Schema  
The airline database consists of multiple interconnected tables:  

- **Bookings** – Stores booking details, including booking reference, date of booking, and total fare.  
- **Tickets** – Contains issued ticket information, such as ticket number, passenger details, and associated booking reference.  
- **Boarding Passes** – Tracks boarding pass issuance, including ticket numbers, boarding order, and assigned seats.  
- **Flights** – Maintains flight details like flight number, departure and arrival locations, scheduled and actual timings, and flight status.  
- **Aircrafts** – Stores aircraft specifications, including model type and unique aircraft code.  
- **Airports** – Holds airport metadata, including airport codes and respective time zones.  
- **Seats** – Defines seat arrangements, availability, and fare conditions for different aircraft.
